					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a senior at Gharbiya STEM. I've always had a
						strange connection to the night sky. While growing up, I began to
						research topics in Physics and Astronomy on my own. When I first
						started high school, I wanted to help students struggling with
						Physics, so I organized night sessions for sophomores and juniors.
						To make Physics more accessible, I started my own Physics website,
						where I regularly publish articles on various topics.
